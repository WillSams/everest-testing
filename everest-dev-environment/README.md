# EVerest dev environment

This subproject contains all utility files for setting up your development environment. So far this is the [edm - the Everest Dependency Manager](dependency_manager/README.md) which helps you orchestrating the dependencies between the different everest repositories.

You can install [edm](dependency_manager/README.md) very easy using pip.

All documentation and the issue tracking can be found in our main repository here: https://github.com/EVerest/everest
